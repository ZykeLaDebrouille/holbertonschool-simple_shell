## Foreword: What is a Unix Shell?

**Definition:**

A Unix Shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a command-line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. It serves as both an interactive command language and a scripting language, allowing users to control system operations through shell scripts.

**Basic Concepts**

  - **Interaction:** User typically interact with a Unix shell via a terminal emulator, but direct connections via hardware or **Secure Shell (SSH)** are common for server systems.

  - **Features:** All Unix shells provide filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration. 

### Types of Shells

1. **Thompson Shell (`sh`)**

	- **Author:** Ken Thompson
	- **First version:** November 1971
	- **Innovations:** Introduced `input/output` redirection and pipes to connect the `output` of one command to the `input` of another.
	- **Design:** Minimalistic, lacking support for comments or environment variables. Commands `if` and `goto` are separate, and pipre and redirection handling were refined in later versions.


2. **Bourne Shell (`sh`)**

	- **Author:** Stephen Bourne
	- **First version:** 1979 with Unix Version 7
	- **Innovations:** Added features like `here documents`, `command substitution`, and more extensive control structures.
	- **Modern Variants:**
    	- **Almiquist Shell (`ash`):** Use in resource-constrained environments.
    	- **Busybox:** Includes `ash` and `hush` for small and embedded systems.
    	- **Debian Almquist Shell (`dash`):** A modern replacement for `ash` in Debian and Ubuntu.
    	- **Bourne-Again Shell (`bash`):** Provides a superset of Bourne Shell functionalities and is the default shell for most Linux systems.
    	- **KornShell (`ksh`), MirBSD Korn Shell (`mksh`), Z shell (`zsh`):** Each offers extensions and improvements over the Bourne Shell.


3. **C Shell (csh)**

	- **Author:** Bill Joy
	- **First Version:** Developed at the University of California, Berkely, and widely distributed with BSD Unix.
	- **Innovations:** Introduced features for interactive work such as command history, aliases, directory stacks, and job control. Evolved into TENEX C Shell (`tcsh`) with enhancements.

### Shell configuration

Shells read configuration files to customize their behavior. Here is an overview of configuration files for popular shells:

| **Configuration File** | **sh**  | **ksh** | **csh** | **tcsh** | **bash** | **zsh** |
|------------------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| `/etc/profile`         | yes     | yes     | yes     | yes      | yes      | yes 	   |
| `~/.profile`           | yes     | yes     | yes     | yes      | yes      | yes 	   |
| `~/.bash_profile`      |         |         |         |          | yes      |     	   |
| `~/.bashrc`            |         |         |         |          | yes      |     	   |
| `~/.zshrc`             |         |         |         |          |          | yes 	   |


### System Calls

**Definition:**

**System calls** are functions provided by the operating system kernel that allow programs to interact directly with hardware or request low-level services. Here is an overview of key sustems calls and their usage in Unix shells.

**Key System Calls**

   - **`fork()`:** Creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. Used to launch commands in a shell.
   - **`exec()`:** Replaces the current process image with a new process image. Used to execute commands in a shell.
   - **`wait()`:** Waits for child processes to terminate. Used to synchronize process execution.
   - **`pipe()`:** Creates a communication channel between processes, allowing redirection of one process's output to another's input.
   - **`chdir()`:** Changes the current working directory of the process.
   - **`open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`:** Basic file operations.
  
**Why Avoid Direct System Calls?**

- **Complexity:** Direct use of system calls can make code more complexe and harder to maintain.
- **Portability:** System calls can vary between operating systems. Scripts using these calls directly may not be portable across different Unix versions or distributions.
- **Security:** Errors in using system calls can introduce security vulnerabilities.
- **Abstraction:** Unix shells provide abstractions that simplify system interaction, such as rediction, pipes, and environment variables, Using these abstractions is often safer and easier than direct system call usage.

### Interactive and Non-Interactive Modes

**Interactive Mode:**

  - **Definition:**
	
	In **interactive mode**, the shell waits for user input, processes commands as they are entered, and provides immediate feedback.

  - **Features:**

    - **Command History:** Users can navigate through previously executed commands.
    - **Autocompletion:** The shell can auto-complete file names and commands.
    - **Prompt:** The shell displays a prompt indicating that it is ready to accept commands.
  
  - **Use Case:** 
  
  This mode is commonly used in terminal sessions where users manually enter commands to interact with the system.  

**Non-Interactive Mode:**

  - **Definition:**

  In **non-interactive mode**, the shell executes commands from a script or a file without user interaction. It reads commands from a script or input file and processes them in sequence.

  - **Features:**
    
	- **Script Execution:** Useful for automating tasks such as system maintenance, software installation, and backups.
	- **No Prompt:** There is a no prompt for user input; commands are executed in the background.

  - **Use Case:**

  This mode is ideal for running automated scripts or batch processing tasks where user interaction is not required.  

**Conclusion**

Unix shells play a crucial role in interacting with Unix-like operating systems, offering robust features for users and system administrators. While underlying system calls are fundamental to shell operation, it is generally preferable to use the abstractions provided by the shells for routine tasks to simplify development, enhance portability, and ensure security.

## Introduction to the project `Simple Shell`

In this project, we will develop a fundamental Unix command-line interpreter, resembling a traditional  Unix shell, but simpler (which give the name "Simple Shell").

### Mandatory tasks

Our objectives for the mandatory taks are:

1. **Code Quality:** Adhere to Betty Coding style guidelines to ensure cleanr, readable code.

2. **Basi Shell Implementaion:**  Create a simple shell that:
	- Displays a prompt and processes single-word commands.
	- Handles errors, including unrecognized commands and **end-of-file** confitions (Ctrl+D).
	- Repeats the prompt after each command execution (going back to the line to allow the user to type again.)

3. **More Functionalities:** Extense the shell to handle commands with arguments and manage executable paths correctly 

4. **Built-in Commands:** Implement basic built-in commands, including `exit` to terminate the shell and `env` to display environment variables.

### Advances tasks

Despite not having time to do all the mandatory tasks we wanted to do (especially about the PATH), we managed to do some - easy - advanced tasks such as :

**12. Simple shell 0.4.2:**
   - Handeling `Ctrl+C` to not quit when the user inputs is `^C` 

## Usage

The Simple Shell can be used in both interactive and non-interactive modes.

### Interactive Mode

In interactive mode, the shell displays a prompt and waits for user input.

To start the shell in interactive mode:

```bash
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls -l

($) exit
```
### Non-Interactive Mode

In non-interactive mode, the shell reads commands from a pipe of a file (if implemented)

```bash
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
0_calloc.c                 4_execute_command.c         README.md           simpleshell.h
0_strlen.c                 5_print_env.c               a.out               test_pour_moi
1_read_line.c              6_built_in.c                hsh
2_split_string_in_token.c  7_free_tokenised_command.c  main.c
3_remove_newline.c         AUTHORS                     man_1_simple_shell
$
```

Example now using a file (assuming you have a file name `commands.txt` with shell commands). Here we created especially a `commands.txt` with just the following command inside : `ls -l` 

```bash
$ ./hsh < commands.txt

drwxr-xr-x 2 arc arc  4096 Aug 22 19:00 test_pour_moi
```

In both modes, the Simple Shell supports basic command execution, including commands with arguments and those found in the PATH.

### How we tested our project.

In this section, we are going to focus on the construction of the script itself and especially how we tested it..

So, to provide a safe environnement to test our functions without messing everything up, we created both of us a separate branch.

We adjusted or implemented the changes what we wanted to try, then compiled everything together like this:

```sh
gcc -g -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```

to test if it works.

**Testing with Valgrind:**

To ensure there are no memory leaks or other issues, we used Valgrind for testing at each step. Hereâs a brief example command to check for memory-related problems:

```sh
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ./hsh
```

This allowed us to verify if our function operated correctly and efficiently, ensuring reliable performance in various scenarios.

### Some tests to try:

Here are some simple tests to try: 

*Displaying path to the working directory*
```sh
/bin/pwd
```

*A test to see how tokenized works in our shell*
```sh
/bin/ls -l
```

*A test to clear the terminal*
```sh
/bin/clear
```

### Bugs

**Mandatory features not-implemented:**

As you may have seen, everything isn't running smoothly. There are some bugs. The biggest one, isn't a "bug" in itself but more that we didn't had time to finish. we couldn't code the all the "PATH" related tasks. So, as you could see in the previous tests, we are obliged to use `/bin/` before calling a function.

**Valgrind:**

*Valgrind Output tested with "ls"*

Here we can see there is no **leaks** in itself but yet, it's not clear. There is still reachable memory.

## Manpage `Simple Shell`

A "Manpage" is short for "Manual Page". This is a command scripted to display the manual page of `Simple Shell`, explaining the command and how to use it, while being in bash.

**Step 1: Move the Man page to system directory**

First, it's requiered to move the necessary man page to the required directory.

```sh
sudo mv man_1_simple_shell /usr/local/man1/man_1_simple_shell.1
```

**Step 2: Restore man page from git repository (is necessary)**

After creating the directory structure, installing the manpage with `sudo`to ensure to have the necessary permissions:

```sh
git restore man_1_simple_shell 
```

Little breakdown about what this all about:

  - **`mv man_1_simple_shell`:** move the man page

  - **`git restore`:** restore a file

  - **`man_1_simple_shell`:** The source file for the manpage.

  - **`usr/local/man/man1/`:** The destination path for the installed manpage.


**Step 3: Update the manpage database**

You already have a manpage database holding the man of other commands. You need to update it so that `man` can find the new manpage:

```sh
sudo mandb
```

**Step 4: Try it**

```sh
man simple_shell
```

## Conclusion

To conclude, this project has been a challenge in overall. Asking for us to use a lot of things we learned throught this trimester. It has been difficult and challenging especially to work on a such a big project in group. But in the end, even if we may have not finished entierly, it mostly works and above all, we understand everything we've done.
