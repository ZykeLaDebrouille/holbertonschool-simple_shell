.SH NAME
simple_shell \- this is our shell

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell [command] [file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Generally, a shell is a program that executes other programs in response to text commands
Simple Shell is a simple UNIX command interpreter that mimics the behavior of the standard UNIX shell.
It reads commands from the user, parses them, and executes them as if they were entered in a standard shell.

A Unix Shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a command-line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. It serves as both an interactive command language and a scripting language, allowing users to control system operations through shell scripts.

Features: All Unix shells provide filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.

.SH OPTIONS

.SH BUILTIN COMMANDS
The following commands below are called and handled directly in the shell.
Therefore, these commands do not need to call upon a child process to be
executed. However, with the exit builtin it returns an exits status of 0
on successful execution. In failure, the exit will return 126 when the
command invoked can not execute. Also, it will return 127 when the command
is not found. It will return a value of 2 in failure--misuse of the shell
builtin.

The following commands are executed in the shell as builtins

.B exit

	Exits the shell

.B env

	Prints the variables from the current environment
