.SH DESCRIPTION

Simple Shell is a simple UNIX command interpreter that mimics the behavior of the standard UNIX shell.
It reads commands from the user, parses them, and executes them as if they were entered in a standard shell.

A Unix Shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a command-line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. It serves as both an interactive command language and a scripting language, allowing users to control system operations through shell scripts.

Features: All Unix shells provide filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.
